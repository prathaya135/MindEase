## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the MindEase project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (for frontend and backend)
* npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
* Python 3 (for the mood detection model)
* pip (Python Package Installer, comes with Python 3)

### Installation and Running

You will need to run the backend, frontend, and the mood detection model separately.

#### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port, check your `index.js` for the exact port).

#### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

#### Mood Detection Model

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required Python libraries for the mood detection model:
    ```bash
    pip install flask flask-cors tensorflow opencv-python
    ```
3.  Run the Python script for the mood detection model. This script should be located in your project's root or a designated `model` directory. Adjust the path if necessary.
    ```bash
    python emotions.py
    ```
    This will start a Flask server for your mood detection model, usually on `http://localhost:5000`.

**Note:** Ensure all three components (backend, frontend, and model) are running concurrently for the full functionality of the application.
